fix: swipe backwards in single stop mode/align center goes more than 1 slide

import intellisense
add responsive height?
change onSwipeStart to include direction and change in direction
compare with react-slick, swiper-js, keen-slider (similar implementation), nuka-carousel
other props: easingFunction, autoplay, lazy loading
add codegenerator
Change braking to number with min and need
Change snap back time to snap back speed
