## Usage

The Swiper component returns a container with all the provided children slide components and an optional Overlay component rendered on top of the slides. The `height` of the container is controlled by the slides, so make sure their `height`s are set. The container `width` is set to 100% by default and the slide `width` can be set by the slide or can be set using the `fit` property (i.e. `fit = 2` will set the slide `width`s to half of the container `width`). This is all assuming a default horizontal Swiper; when `vertical` is `true`, you have to set `height` on the Swiper container and should also set the slide `width`s.

In order to prevent html image dragging interfering with swiping, `-webkit-user-drag` is set to `none` for all child img elements. This behavior can be overwritten if desired.

## SwiperMethods

The `onLoad` and `Overlay` props give access to the swiper control `SwiperMethods` that allows you to programmatically control the swiper.

```
interface SwiperMethods {
	/** go to a slide */
	goTo: (slide: number) => void
	/** go to next slide */
	next: () => void
	/** go to previous slide */
	prev: () => void
}
```

## SwiperOverlay

An `Overlay` component can be defined that covers the full swiper container above the slides. Common use cases involve adding controls and gradient fade effects. The component must return an element (not `null`).

The component will remove pointer events (i.e. `pointer-events: none`) in order to allow clicking through to the slide components. Therefore, if you want to add control elements (left, right, selected dot, etc.) make sure to set `pointer-events: auto` on each element. You can also apply add the control class name to accomplish this - `className="canari-swipe__control"`.

The props given to the component are:

```
interface SwiperOverlayProps {
	currentIndex: number
	methods: SwiperMethods
}
```
